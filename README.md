# Project 2: Legends Games

Legend Games is an Experience Cloud site created as a spin off of the online video game store, Steam. Users can create an account, purchase games, view particular sales, and contact support about issues they may have with a game or service. The app includes a search and browse section where a user can look for individual games and/or view all available games. Once logged in, the user can view and edit their account information, reset their password, as well as see a list of the games they have purchased alongside the most popular games on the Legend Games site. Finally, users are able to write reviews for games and look up reviews left by other users for a particular game.
